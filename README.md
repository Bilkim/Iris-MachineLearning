# Iris-MachineLearning
Iris dataset classification and model creation and training

The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is one of the most famous multivariate data set used for testing various Machine Learning Algorithms.

# Data Insights:
    The pdf curve of Iris Setosa ends roughly at 2.1
    If petal length < 2.1, then species is Iris Setosa
    The point of intersection between pdf curves of Versicolor and Virginica is roughly at 4.8
    If petal length > 2.1 and petal length < 4.8 then species is Iris Versicolor
    If petal length > 4.8 then species is Iris Virginica
